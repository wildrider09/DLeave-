# DLeave
The app is designed such that the user can request leave or manage leave requests from a mobile device while on the go. User can request leaves by filling in an intuitive leave application form with notes and submit them to their manager. The manager can in turn check the requestor’s leave balance and approve / reject the leave. The requestor gets to see the approver’s decision.
